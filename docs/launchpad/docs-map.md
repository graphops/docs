# Launchpad Documentation

Everything you need to know about the Launchpad project.

## First steps

Are you new to Launchpad or to Kubernetes? Here's a high-level overview of how this documentation is organised, to help you know where to look for the information you need:

* **From Scratch** - this includes overview of the project, details on the project modularity and how you can leverage features of Launchpad as best suits your needs: [Launchpad Introduction](intro) | [Opt in features](modularity) | [Installation](client-side-tooling) 
* **Project Maintenance** - find out how often new versions of the project are released and how GraphOps decides what namespaces and chains to support: [Release Channels](release-channels) | [Supported Namespaces](supported-namespaces)
* **Tutorials** - guides to get you started with Launchpad, everything you need to deploy different blockchain nodes and guides on what you need for highly available postgresql and monitoring: [Getting Started](quick-start) | [Arbitrum-One Guide](tutorials/arbitrum-archive-kubernetes-guide) | [Celo-Mainnet Guide](tutorials/celo-archive-kubernetes-guide) | [PostgreSQL HA](tutorials/postgresql_ha.md) | [Monitoring Stack HA](tutorials/monitoring-stack-with-HA.md)
* **Advanced Tutorials** - want to start with Launchpad but you don't yet have a Kubernetes Cluster? Find out how to create one: [Creating a Kubernetes Cluster with kubeadm](advanced-tutorials/kubernetes-create-cluster-with-kubeadm) | [Creating a Kubernetes Cluster with FCOS](advanced-tutorials/advanced-kubernetes.md)
