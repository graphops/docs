# 🧰 SDK

As mentioned before, the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphops/graphcast) is the base layer which is used to abstract all the necessary components of each Radio away from the
user. In the current Graphcast POC implementation that's achieved by a few structs that hold the needed functionality.

To explore what the SDK provides, you can clone the [graphcast-sdk repo](https://github.com/graphops/graphcast-sdk) and run `cargo doc --open`, that will generate the docs locally and open them directly in your browser.
