# ðŸ§° SDK

As mentioned before, the SDK is the base layer which is used to abstract all the necessary components of each Radio away from the
user. In the current Graphcast POC implementation that's achieved by a few structs that hold the needed functionality.

To explore what the SDK provides, you can clone the [graphcast-sdk repo](https://github.com/graphops/graphcast-sdk) and run `cargo doc --open`, that will generate the docs locally and open them directly in your browser.
