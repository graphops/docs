# üßë‚Äçüíª Radio Development

Do you want to build robust, peer-to-peer messaging apps that automatically exchanges valuable data with other Indexers in real time? Do you have an idea for what data could be useful to share that could lead to greater communication efficiency in The Graph network as a whole? Then you want to build a Radio on top of the Graphcast network.

:::warning
As of today, the Graphcast SDK is not published to [crates.io](https://crates.io), but the examples below will clearly illustrate how functions and structs would be imported from it and used once it gets published. It should be treated as pseudocode for the time being and will not work properly if you try to run it on its own.
:::

For a more complex and full example of the Graphcast SDK being used to create a POI cross-checker Radio, take a look at this [implementation in the POC repo](https://github.com/graphops/graphcast-poc/tree/main/src/examples/poi-crosschecker).

## A simple ping pong example

Let's take a look at the simples possible example of a Radio, built on top of Graphcast - a ping pong app. When one participant sends `Ping`, all the others in the network are listening on the ping pong topic will send `Pong` back. Pretty straightforward.

### Register an operator address

First things first - before you can run any Radio on Graphcast, you need to register an operator address for your on-chain Indexer address. You can do that by using our [Registry smart contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x1e408c2cf66fd3afcea0f49dc44c9f4db5575e79) (on the Goerli network).

:::tip
The easiest way to do that is through [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (you can check out [this guide](https://medium.com/blockchain-stories/interacting-with-an-ethereum-smart-contract-aa14401c30a0)). You need to use your Indexer wallet to call the `setGossipOperator` function, providing the address you wish to use as an operator (in all lower-case characters). You can find the contract abi [here](https://github.com/graphops/graphcast-poc/blob/main/registryAbi.json).
:::

Once that's done, you can start building your very first Radio.

### Populate your `.env` file

You now need to export two environment variables, `ETH_NODE` (url to an Ethereum node) and `PRIVATE_KEY` (your operator address private key).

Please use a Goerli ETH node for this example (doesn't need to be a full node).

### A few dependencies

Start off with a new Rust project (`cargo new ping-pong`). Then add the following dependencies to you `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
graphcast_sdk = "0.0.1"
once_cell = "1.15"
tokio = { version = "1.1.1", features = ["full"] }
anyhow = "1.0.39"
ethers = "1.0.0"
```

### The imports

Open your `main.rs` file and add the following imports:

```Rust
use ethers::{
    providers::{Http, Middleware, Provider},
    types::U64,
};
use graphcast_sdk::gossip_agent::message_typing::GraphcastMessage;
use graphcast_sdk::gossip_agent::GossipAgent;
use once_cell::sync::OnceCell;
use std::env;:
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::{thread::sleep, time::Duration};
use tokio::sync::Mutex as AsyncMutex;
```

### Structure

Everything we need will be inside the `main()` function. And since we'll be using async code we have to annotate it with `#[tokio::main]`, we can start off with something as simple as:

```
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  // TODO: Radio logic
}
```

### Instantiate the essentials

Let's instantiate a few variables that will do all the heavy lifting for us.

First is the vector we'll use to store incoming messages:

```Rust
pub static MESSAGES: OnceCell<Arc<Mutex<Vec<GraphcastMessage>>>> = OnceCell::new();
```

That line may look intimidating, but really it's just defining a global static instance of a `GraphcastMessage` vector. It is used to save incoming messages after they've been validated, in order to defer their processing for later, because async code is required for the processing but is not allowed inside the handler function.

Next is an instance of `GossipAgent`:

```Rust
pub static GOSSIP_AGENT: OnceCell<GossipAgent> = OnceCell::new();
```

This is also a global static definition, because the Radio handler requires a static immutable context and the handler itself is being passed into the GossipAgent, so it needs to be static as well.

We also need to load our environment variables:

```Rust
let private_key = env::var("PRIVATE_KEY").expect("No operator private key provided.");
let eth_node = env::var("ETH_NODE").expect("No ETH URL provided.");
```

Using the Ethereum node we can now set up a provider instance that will help us read on-chain data:

```Rust
let provider: Provider<Http> = Provider::<Http>::try_from(eth_node.clone()).unwrap();
```

Next, we will set our Radio name (can be any string) and instantiate a `GossipAgent`:

```Rust
let radio_name: &str = "ping-pong";

let gossip_agent = GossipAgent::new(
    private_key,
    eth_node,
    radio_name,
    Some(vec!["ping-pong-content-topic"]),
)
.await
.unwrap();
```

It's important to note that the `Some(vec!["ping-pong-content-topic"])` can be any vector of strings, but we can also pass in `None`, that way the SDK will default to using the ipfs hashes of the subgraphs that the Indexer is allocation to as initial content topics. But in this case we are overriding it with something much more simple.

And lastly for the setup part, we need to run two one-off setters for `GossipAgent` and for the incomingthe messages store:

```Rust
_ = GOSSIP_AGENT.set(gossip_agent);
_ = MESSAGES.set(Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![])));
```

Awesome, we're all set to start with the actual Radio logic now!

### Sending messages

We'll define a helper function that holds the logic of sending messages to the Graphcast network:

```Rust
async fn send_message(content: String, block_number: u64) {
        match GOSSIP_AGENT
            .get()
            .unwrap()
            .send_message(
                "ping-pong-content-topic".to_string(),
                block_number,
                content,
            )
            .await
        {
            Ok(sent) => println!("Sent message id:: {}", sent),
            Err(e) => println!("Failed to send message: {}", e),
        };
    }
```

Again, the `identifier` that we define as `ping-pong-content-topic` can be any string that suits your Radio logic, if it doesn't really matter for your use case (like in the ping-pong Radio case) you can just use a UUID or a hardcoded string.

### Receiving and handling messages

We now know how to send message, but how do we receive and handle message from other network participants?

We need to define a custom callback handler that specifies what to do with incoming messages. There cannot be any async code inside the handler, that's why we're saving the incoming message (after it has been validated by the SDK) for later processing, where we will check it's content and perform some action based on it.

Here is a simple handler that does just that:

```Rust
let radio_handler = |msg: Result<GraphcastMessage, anyhow::Error>| match msg {
        Ok(msg) => {
            println!("New message received! {:?}\n Saving to message store.", msg);
            MESSAGES.get().unwrap().lock().unwrap().push(msg);
        }
        Err(err) => {
            println!("{}", err);
        }
    };

GOSSIP_AGENT
    .get()
    .unwrap()
    .register_handler(Arc::new(Mutex::new(radio_handler)));
```

### The main loop

Great, we're almost there! We have a way to pass messages back and forth üèì. But sending a one-off message is no fun, we want to create some sort of scheduled and continuous logic of message exchange, and perhaps the easiest way to do that is to use the Ethereum block number as cue.

We'll start listening to Ethereum blocks and on each block we'll do a simple check - if the block number is even we'll send a "Ping" message, and if it's odd we'll process the messages we've received. After processing the messages we'll clear our store.

```Rust
loop {
    let block_number = U64::as_u64(&provider.get_block_number().await.unwrap());
    println!("üîó Block number: {}", block_number);

    if block_number & 2 == 0 {
        send_message("Ping".to_string(), block_number).await;
    } else {
        let messages = AsyncMutex::new(MESSAGES.get().unwrap().lock().unwrap());
        for msg in messages.lock().await.iter() {
            if msg.content == *"Ping" {
                send_message("Pong".to_string(), block_number).await;
            }
        }

        messages.lock().await.clear();
    };

    sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));
}
```

### The finished Radio

Congratulations, you've now written you first full Graphcast Radio! The finished code is also available in [this repo](https://github.com/graphops/graphcast-sdk/tree/main/examples/ping-pong), the only important difference is in the dependencies.

### That's awesome. But how do we run it?

You can start up the ping-pong Radio using `cargo run boot`.

Now there's just one more thing to do - have fun examining the logs & be proud of yourself - you made it! ü•Ç From here on out, the only limit to the Radios you can build is your own imagination.
