It is designed to overcome the high cost of signaling or coordination between blockchain participants by enabling off-chain communication (gossip/cheap talk). This is particularly useful for applications where real-time communication is essential but the cost of on-chain transactions is prohibitive.","sidebar":"gnSidebar"},"graphcast/sdk/radio-dev":{"id":"graphcast/sdk/radio-dev","title":"Radio Development","description":"Do you want to build robust, peer-to-peer messaging apps that automatically exchange valuable data with other Indexers in real time?

Then you want to build a Radio on top of the Graphcast network.","sidebar":"gnSidebar"},"graphcast/sdk/registry":{"id":"graphcast/sdk/registry","title":"Registry","description":"The Graphcast Registry contracts allow an address to set a GraphcastID by calling setGraphcastID(indexeraddress, graphcastIDaddress) as either an Indexer or an Indexer operator, or calling setGraphcastID(graphcastID_address) as the Indexer address. The relationship between an Indexer address to its GraphcastID is limited to 1:1, and cannot be set to itself. This restriction provides consistency and security for the Indexer identity to operate on Graphcast as one GraphcastID operating across Radio applications. To learn more about the registry, you can check out the Github repository.","sidebar":"gnSidebar"},"launchpad/advanced/advanced-kubernetes":{"id":"launchpad/advanced/advanced-kubernetes","title":"Considerations for Kubernetes installation using FCOS","description":"This guide provides a general walkthrough for installing Kubernetes using Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) as the base operating system.","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/client-side-tooling":{"id":"launchpad/client-side-tooling","title":"Client Side Tooling","description":"Launchpad comes with an opinionated set of tools on your local machine, layered over one another to provide a declarative workflow through all the layers of your infrastructure.","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/design-principles":{"id":"launchpad/design-principles","title":"Design Principles","description":"Design Principles","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/faq":{"id":"launchpad/faq","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","description":"Do I need a server for launchpad-starter?","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/guides/arbitrum-archive-kubernetes-guide":{"id":"launchpad/guides/arbitrum-archive-kubernetes-guide","title":"Arbitrum Archive Mainnet Node Guide","description":"This Quick Start guide has not yet been updated for Launchpad V2.","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/guides/avalanche-archive-kubernetes":{"id":"launchpad/guides/avalanche-archive-kubernetes","title":"Avalanche Archive Mainnet Node Guide","description":"This Quick Start guide has not yet been updated for Launchpad V2.","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/guides/celo-archive-kubernetes-guide":{"id":"launchpad/guides/celo-archive-kubernetes-guide","title":"Celo Archive Mainnet Node Guide","description":"This Quick Start guide has not yet been updated for Launchpad V2.","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/guides/goerli-indexer-guide":{"id":"launchpad/guides/goerli-indexer-guide","title":"Goerli Indexer Guide","description":"This guide is intended to be an end to end walk-through of setting up an Indexer running on the Graph Protocol Testnet on the Ethereum Goerli network.","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/guides/install-fcos":{"id":"launchpad/guides/install-fcos","title":"FCOS Installation","description":"Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) is an open-source container-focused operating system that is:","sidebar":"launchpadSidebar"},"launchpad/intro":{"id":"launchpad/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Launchpad is a toolkit for running a Graph Protocol Indexer on Kubernetes.
